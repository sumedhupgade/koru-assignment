Framework used : Angularjs , bootstrap

Because of less data availability a page size is set to 15 records per page.
The filter functionality is developed to filter records of all pages & show matching data from whole collection.
The filter works for substrings too.
Each functionality is implemented for 1 tab but can be reused for other tabs too.
Whenever a new row is inserted in table the id assigned to it is based on last record present in table.
Select all rows functionality will select complete data not just rows of active page.

To run the project:
1) Enter command npm i
2) Enter command npm start
3) use url http://localhost:8000/ to access app.
